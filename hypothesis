Write a program to find all the prime numbers between 1 and 100. 
One way to do this is to write a function that will check if a number is prime 
(i.e., see if the number can be divided by a prime number smaller then itself) 
using a vector of primes in order ) so that if the vector is called primes, primes[0]==2, primes[1]==3, primes[2]==5, etc). 
Then write a loop that goes from 1 to 100, checks each number to see if it’s a prime, and store each prime found in a vector, 
write another loop that lists the primes you found you might
